# Introduction

Why should research be reproducible?

--

.pull-left[

For Science

- to have a standard that allows to judge scientific claims
- Avoiding duplication and encourage cumulative knowledge development

]

--

.pull-right[

For You

- gain better work habits
- simplify and deepen teamwork
- changes are easier
- gain higher impact (?)

# Reproducible Research

.italic["Replication is the ultimate standard by which scientific claims are judged."]

--

.italic["However, with computational science and the corresponding collection of large and complex data sets the notion of replication can be murkier."]

--

Accordingly, Researchers .italic["(...) have been calling for reproducibility, or reproducible research, as an attainable minimum standard for assessing the value of scientific claims, particularly when full independent replication of a study is not feasible."]

# Reproducible Research

Today, most of our work is data-intensive work (or we make it as such thanks to computers).

We live in the "fourth paradigm" (Gray 2009)

New, pi-shaped scientists are needed (Marwick 2017) and students have to be trained to be such (Faris 2011).

# Containerization

.center[![:scale 10%](./figures/docker_logo.png)]

or "operating-system-level virtualization" or .italic[made to last/run forever]

- create a container with all your data, software, scripts, publication text
- never run into the issue of incompatible or too old software versions

# Data publishing

.pull-left[
.center[![:scale 30%](figures/zenodo.png)]
- since 2013; developed by CERN; EU funded by project OpenAIREplus
- choose free license
]

.pull-right[
.center[![](figures/Figshare_logo.svg)]
- since 2011; for profit
- Create Common license
]

.center[
<br>
- open for all research
- provide DOI for each object
- connect user accounts via ORCID
- Synchronise to releases of software on Github

# Start now.

It's easy, advantageous, and sustainable. Don't wait to invest the one time effort to switch your workflow.

--

One last question: Who has access to your publications? 

--

Preprints e.g. at .bold[SocArXiv] (https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/) are an easy and effortless way to guarantee access to your publications for everyone.
